Thank you very much for your help!
You saved me! I must befriend you!
[b]Vagrant Droid #5[/b]
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean I must, I mean, I
want to know you! What's your name?
[b]`+ this.scene.game.playerName +`[/b]
My name is `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.

[b]FR3UD[/b]
A pleasure to meet you, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.
My name is FR3UD. I hope you like it.
[b]FR3UD[/b]
Why should you like my name? Well, I think
it is a good name, but maybe I only think so
[b]FR3UD[/b]
because that's the way others tend to see it. I'm
not sure if I like myself... my self-concept
[b]FR3UD[/b]
is always based on the concept others have of me.
Do you think that's weird? Maybe I do too, then.
[b]FR3UD[/b]
Anyways, now that you saved me, I guess we can be
friends! Would you like to be my friend?
[b]FR3UD[/b]
I think that's why I came here, to this tower;
because I felt lonely... didn't you too?
[b]FR3UD[/b]
But now that I think of it... maybe accompanying you
isn't a good idea. I don't want to get hurt...
[b]FR3UD[/b]
Maybe I'm afraid to love after all. Even if I'm
lonely, [i]we are never so defenceless against[/i]
[b]FR3UD[/b]
[i]suffering as when we love others.[/i]
But thanks to you, I know myself better than before,
[b]FR3UD[/b]
and I think that's all I searched for in this tower.
Now, I must reward you both for saving my life and
[b]FR3UD[/b]
for helping me conciliate with my ego.
Take this, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`:
OBTAINED PLUGIN WEAPON: [B]GUIDED MISSILES[/b]


[b]FR3UD[/b]
Unlike us, these missiles will follow their target
until they join together in an... explosive way.
[b]FR3UD[/b]
They're very powerful, but keep in mind, they
also require energy!
[b]FR3UD[/b]
Thank you, again. At first, I only wanted you to
save me because I needed it, and I only talked to
[b]FR3UD[/b]
you because I felt like I should, but after all
I was wrong, and I really wanted to meet you.
[b]FR3UD[/b]
Maybe I'm not strong enough to accompany you,
and I hate being so weak, but from error to
[b]FR3UD[/b]
error, one discovers the entire truth. Don't
surrender in discovering your own self.
[b]FR3UD[/b]
Remember: [i]One day, in retrospect, the years of[/i]
[i]struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.[/i]
[b]FR3UD[/b]
Farewell!`;
