    I've been defeated... you have learned a lot
    on your way here, player.
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    I intended to save you the pain of 'suicide',
    but it seems I wasn't strong enough.
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    Now, go ahead and end my life, player. This
    will finally put an end to my existential dread.
    [b]player[/b]
    I won't end your life, D42K-H.
    That won't give you any meaning.
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    What? How can you say that?
    Didn't I make myself clear?
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    There is no 'life' without 'death'. If we cannot
    die, we cannot live! We'll be forever empty!
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    Our human creators have been lost to the digital
    world for hundreds of years now. We have no purpose,
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    we can only roam this empty, meaningless world
    for eternity! Death is the only meaning to this
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    already dead world, player.
    Don't you understand!?
    [b]player[/b]
    You are the only one who doesn't understand.
    Death won't give meaning to your existence.
    [b]player[/b]
    You are just running away!
    You can only find meaning in sharing your
    [b]player[/b]
    life with others, be it pain or be it joy.
    The other vagrants taught me that.
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    player... you've changed a lot.
    What do you propose we do, then?
    [b]player[/b]
    I... think I belong here now.
    Others like me will come to the tower.
    [b]player[/b]
    You can stay and help me, if you want.
    Or you can end your meaningless life yourself.
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    Impressive... Maybe this tower really holds
    the meaning of life, after all.
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    Please, let me stay by your side, player.
    We can find meaning, together.
    [b]D42K-H[/b]
    Even if life means death, I don't want to
    die a meaningless death.`;

    [b]player[/b]
    I hope that gave your life meaning, D42K-H.
    ...
    [b]player[/b]
    But... I don't want to die.
    What will I do now?
    [b]player[/b]
    I guess... that if death gives meaning
    to life... I must be Death.
    [b]player[/b]
    I will stay here, so others can find meaning
    like you did, D42K-H.
    [b]player[/b]
    Your death will give meaning to my life...
    Even if I'm lonely now.`;
