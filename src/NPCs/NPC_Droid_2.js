    Thank you, friendly android!
    I take you are a vagrant too, right?
    [b]Vagrant Droid[/b]
    I almost perish before realizing my dream, I
    must thank you for that. What's your name?
    [b]player[/b]
    My name is player.
    
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    A pleasure to meet you, player
    My name is Y04K3
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    I'm a vagrant droid, just as you, searching 
    for the truth in this desolated tower...
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    I can't believe how fogged the hive mind of
    the droids here has come to be, they're like
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    empty killing machines, hiding from the fact
    that their purpose is now meaningless, refusing
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    to face this world as it is. They're just hiding
    in this hollow, mechanical forest...
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    You know, I refuse to be like them. As painful
    as it may be, [i]I'll reach out to the truth![/i]
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    What's truth, you say? It's different for everyone.
    The only one who really knows, is your [i]true self.[/i]
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    Be sure to find your true self, player.
    As for me, I think I feel truer than ever, now
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    that I got to meet you! Thank you, really.
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    Now, before you part, please let me give you
    something to help you on your journey:
    OBTAINED PLUGIN WEAPON: [B]EXPLOSIVE BULLETS[/b]
    
    
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    This explosive ammo will do more damage than
    your normal ammo, causing damage in area as well!
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    Now nothing will stay in your way to find 
    your own truth, player!
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    In my case, I don't think I need to see the birth
    of a new star to find truth, I just don't want
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    to lie to myself, never again.
    Thank you for helping realizing this!
    [b]Y04K3[/b]
    May you find your own truth, player.
    Farewell!`;
